= Setup and Exercise 1.0 - Running Ad Hoc Commands

== Section 0: Setup

This lab provides a quick tour of the browser based SSH client Wetty. To help you get familiar with lab environment along with some key terminology we will use in subsequent lab content.


== Accessing Wetty

Use this URL to access the Wetty node, just change the workshopname and region (if applicable). Ask your instructor for the workshopname and region.

[source,bash]
----
{{< urifqdn_azure "https://" "tower" ":8888" >}}
----

----
login: azure-user
Password: redhat!@#
----

After logging in, you should see a shell.

[IMPORTANT]
Be sure you can log in to your instances.  If you can't log in start shouting, loudly, and waving your hands!

[IMPORTANT]
DO NOT FORGET the prerequisites - as you may need to install ____ on the Ansible Engine host!

{{<ref "prerequisites" >}}


{{<ref "prerequisites" >}}[Prequisites]

[Prequisites]({{<ref "prerequisites" >}})

[Prequisites relative]({{<relref "prerequisites" >}})

({{<relref "prerequisites" >}})

== End Result

At this point, you should have logged into your node and made sure all the prerequisites are fulfilled .  If you haven't, let us know so we can get you fixed up.




== Section 1: Ad hoc commands

For our first exercise, we are going to run some ad hoc commands AGAINST WINDOWS Nodes to help you get a feel for how Red Hat Ansible Tower works.  Ansible ad hoc commands enable you to perform repeatable tasks on remote nodes, without having to write a playbook.  They are very useful when you simply need to do one or two tasks quickly and often, to many remote nodes.

=== Set Up Dependencies:

Define your inventory.  As you know, inventories are crucial to Ansible, as they define remote machines on which you will run commands or your playbook(s).  Use `vi` or `vim` to create a file called `windows.hosts`.  Then, add the appropriate definitions for the node that will function as a web node.

====
[NOTE]
The *workshopname*, in the example below, will be provided to you by your instructor.  The *#* should be replaced by your student number.

For example, a recent workshop's first student used:
*{{< urifqdn_azure "" "windows" "" >}}*
====

.windows.hosts (example)
[source,bash]
----
[windows]
{{< urifqdn_azure "" "windows" "" >}}
172.16.94.156
----

Additionally we need to setup some special variables for connecting to Windows hosts via WinRM:
.windows.hosts (example)
[source,bash]
----
[windows:vars]
ansible_user=adminAccount
ansible_password=adminPassword
ansible_connection=winrm
ansible_winrm_server_cert_validation=ignore
----

more information on these variables can be found at https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/windows_winrm.html?highlight=pywinrm

so our complete `windows.hosts` should look like:
.windows.hosts (example)
[source,bash]
----
[windows:vars]
ansible_user=adminAccount
ansible_password=adminPassword
ansible_connection=winrm
ansible_winrm_server_cert_validation=ignore

[windows]
{{< urifqdn_azure "" "windows" "" >}}
172.16.94.156
----

[NOTE]
Best practice is to place these variables in a more secure location than as variables in the inventory. This workshop is done this way to ease understanding of what is happening for initial connectivity to a Windows environment.


=== Step 1: Test windows host response

Let's start with something basic - pinging a host.  The `ping` module tests the responsiveness of our NON-Windows hosts, where win_ping is used to ping windows hosts.

[source,bash]
----
ansible windows -m win_ping
----

=== Step 2: Run a Windows command

Now let's see how we can run a windows command , using the `win_command` module.


[source,bash]
----
ansible windows -m win_command -a "powershell.exe Write-Host this is like an echo statement"
----

or

[source,bash]
----
ansible windows -m win_command -a "powershell.exe Get-Host"
----

or

[source,bash]
----
ansible windows -m win_command -a "powershell.exe Get-Random"
----

or

[source,bash]
----
ansible windows -m win_command -a "powershell.exe ls c:"
----


=== Step 3: Review the setup module

Take a look at your Windows node's configuration.  The `setup` module displays Ansible facts (and a lot of them) about an endpoint.

[source,bash]
----
ansible windows -m setup
----

====
[NOTE]
Many Windows command line calls are done via powershell.exe. Even simple things like `dir` and `ls` are done that way.
https://devblogs.microsoft.com/scripting/table-of-basic-powershell-commands/ has a log of interactions that can be performed this way. https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.utility has even more ways to interact with windows via the command line
